Description: This package includes functions for assessing the quality of single-cell transcriptomic data 
  using cell type-specific marker gene expression. 
  These functions were initially tailored for data 
  collected using the patch-seq methodology, but are 
  applicable to other single-cell RNAseq datasets.
